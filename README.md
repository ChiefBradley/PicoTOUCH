# PicoTOUCH

## Pico-8—*now in mobile flavor!*
The current Pico-8 HTML export does not support touch controls, nor is the webpage produced optimized for mobile.

This project aims to do a few things:

- Implement touch controls
- Beat the existing html into a responsive, mobile-ready webpage
- Add web-app functionality for iOS, allowing the page to be saved to the homescreen and used like a native app (complete with *sound!*), without all of the obstructive Safari UI.

## Achievements
- The page is now responsive and looks very pretty indeed (*at least using an iPhone 7, which is all I have to test with.*)
- The page is web-app ready, and can be saved to the iOS homescreen and run just like an app—sound and all.
- Touch controls have been successfully implemented and are in a usable state, including the in-game pause function.
- Supports both portrait and landscape orientations.
- Supports phone and tablet screen sizes. 

## To-Do
### // Things to Fix

- Limit touch input to button areas. 
- Layouts on non-iOS mobile devices.
